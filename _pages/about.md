# About Me
I'm an ecologist who specializes in scientific programming and large-scale analysis in the domains of ecological forecasting, remote sensing, phenology, and dryland systems. I finished my PhD in 2019 at the University of Florida in the [White Lab](https://www.weecology.org) and was a postdoctoral fellow for two years at the [USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/). I'm skilled in programming (R & python), using high performance computing, and applying ecological models to large scale weather and climate data. Previously I obtained an undergraduate degree in Ecology from the University of Idaho and spent four years working for the US Forest Service, BLM, and Agricultural Research Service. I'm an expert in plants in the Western U.S.A., especially grasses.
