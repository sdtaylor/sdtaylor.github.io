My first semester at the University of Florida I spent *much* too long figuring out what classes to take. This was mainly because of 1) the long list of possible classes for my degree to take across departments and 2) which classes are actually offered in a given semester. Using webscrapers and some python code I built a website that cross references the required class list with the current semester schedule.
