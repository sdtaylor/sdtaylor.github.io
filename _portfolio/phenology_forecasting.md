My primary research involves forecasting the timing of leaf out, flowering, and other phenological events. 
## [phenology.naturecast.org](http://phenology.naturecast.org)
I made this site as a proof of concept for making regular, automatically updated, large scale ecological forecasts. Twice a week it downloads the latest climate forecasts from NOAA, downscales them to a scale suitable for ecology, then, depending on the season, applies several hundred different phenology models for different species. The phenology modeling aspect is broken out into it's [own package](../../publication/2018-pyPhenology) which others are free to use.
